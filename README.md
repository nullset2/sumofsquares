**SUM OF SQUARES**
==================

A quick, trivial script to solve the following problem:

Given a series of numbers:

1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 ... r

Compute the sum of the first 1000 terms in the series.

====================================

The program performs the sum and outputs the result to standard output.
